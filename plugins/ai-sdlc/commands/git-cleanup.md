Post-merge cleanup for the PR: **$ARGUMENTS**
(If no PR is given, use the PR for the current branch.)

Follow the **"Post-merge cleanup"** section of the `ai-sdlc:feature-pipeline`
skill:

1. **Confirm the PR is merged** with
   `gh pr view $ARGUMENTS --json state,mergedAt,baseRefName,headRefName`. If it is not
   merged, **stop and tell me** - change nothing.
   - Current status: !`git status --short --branch`
2. Check out the PR's base branch and `git pull` so local base has the merged work.
3. If the work used a git worktree, remove it (`git worktree remove` + `git worktree
   prune`).
4. Delete the merged local branch with `git branch -d`. Only fall back to `-D` because
   Step 1 already confirmed the merge (e.g. after a squash/rebase merge).
5. `git fetch --prune` to drop stale remote-tracking refs.
6. Report what was cleaned up. **Never delete a branch whose PR isn't confirmed
   merged** - "any local branches" means the merged ones, not unmerged work.
